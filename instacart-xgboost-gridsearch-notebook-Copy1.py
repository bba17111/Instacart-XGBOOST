# Instacart provides 6 CSV files, which we have to load into Python. Towards this end, we use the .read_csv() function, which is included in the Pandas package. Reading in data with the .read_csv( ) function returns a DataFrame.
# 
# First we connect to the Kaggle API in order to download the zip file with the 6 CSVs. Then we unzip it in a new folder named input, and we unzip all the zip files.


# connect to kaggle api and download files (zip)

# This step results in the following DataFrames:
# * <b>orders</b>: This table includes all orders, namely prior, train, and test. It has single primary key (<b>order_id</b>).
# * <b>order_products_train</b>: This table includes training orders. It has a composite primary key (<b>order_id and product_id</b>) and indicates whether a product in an order is a reorder or not (through the reordered variable).
# * <b>order_products_prior </b>: This table includes prior orders. It has a composite primary key (<b>order_id and product_id</b>) and indicates whether a product in an order is a reorder or not (through the reordered variable).

# If you want to reduce the execution time of this Kernel you can use the following piece of code by uncomment it. This will trim the orders DataFrame and will keep a 10% random sample of the users. You can use this for experimentation.

# In[ ]:



#### Remove triple quotes to trim your dataset and experiment with your data
### COMMANDS FOR CODING TESTING - Get 10% of users 
###orders = orders.loc[orders.user_id.isin(orders.user_id.drop_duplicates().sample(frac=0.1, random_state=25))]

# ## 1.3 Reshape data
# We transform the data in order to facilitate their further analysis. First, we convert character variables into categories so we can use them in the creation of the model. In Python, a categorical variable is called category and has a fixed number of different values.

# In[6]:


# We convert character variables into category. 
# In Python, a categorical variable is called category and has a fixed number of different values
aisles['aisle'] = aisles['aisle'].astype('category')
departments['department'] = departments['department'].astype('category')
orders['eval_set'] = orders['eval_set'].astype('category')
products['product_name'] = products['product_name'].astype('category')


# ## 1.4 Create a DataFrame with the orders and the products that have been purchased on prior orders (op)
# We create a new DataFrame, named <b>op</b> which combines (merges) the DataFrames <b>orders</b> and <b>order_products_prior</b>. Bear in mind that <b>order_products_prior</b> DataFrame includes only prior orders, so the new DataFrame <b>op</b>  will contain only these observations as well. Towards this end, we use pandas' merge function with how='inner' argument, which returns records that have matching values in both DataFrames. 
# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zEK7FpY.jpg" width="400">

# In[ ]:


#Merge the orders DF with order_products_prior by their order_id, keep only these rows with order_id that they are appear on both DFs
op = orders.merge(order_products_prior, on='order_id', how='inner')
op.head()


## First approach in one step:
# Create distinct groups for each user, identify the highest order number in each group, save the new column to a DataFrame
user = op.groupby('user_id')['order_number'].max().to_frame('u_total_orders')
user.head()

## Second approach in two steps: 
#1. Save the result as DataFrame with Double brackets --> [[ ]] 
#user = op.groupby('user_id')[['order_number']].max()
#2. Rename the label of the column
#user.columns = ['u_total_orders']
#user.head()


# In[ ]:


# Reset the index of the DF so to bring user_id from index to column (pre-requisite for step 2.4)
user = user.reset_index()
user.head()


# ### 2.1.2 How frequent a customer has reordered products
# 
# This feature is a ratio which shows for each user in what extent has products that have been reordered in the past: <br>
# So we create the following ratio: <br>
# 
# <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{120}&space;\large&space;probability\&space;reordered\&space;(user\_id)=&space;\frac{total\&space;times\&space;of\&space;reorders}{total\&space;number\&space;of\&space;purchased\&space;products\&space;from\&space;all\&space;baskets}" title="probability\ reordered\ (user\_id)= \frac{total\ times\ of\ reorders}{total\ number\ of\ purchased\ products\ from\ all\ baskets}" />
# 
# The nominator is a counter for all the times a user has reordered products (value on reordered=1), the denominator is a counter of all the products that have been purchased on all user's orders (reordered=0 & reordered=1).
# 
# E.g., for a user that has ordered 6 products in total, where 3 times were reorders, the ratio will be:
# 
# ![example ratio](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{120}&space;\large&space;&space;mean=&space;\frac{0&plus;1&plus;0&plus;0&plus;1&plus;1}{6}&space;=&space;0,5) 
# 
# To create the above ratio we .groupby() order_products_prior by each user and then calculate the mean of reordered.
# 

# In[ ]:


u_reorder = op.groupby('user_id')['reordered'].mean().to_frame('u_reordered_ratio')
u_reorder = u_reorder.reset_index()
u_reorder.head()


# The new feature will be merged with the user DataFrame (section 2.1.1) which keep all the features based on users. We perform a left join as we want to keep all the users that we have created on the user DataFrame
# 
# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wMmC4hb.jpg" width="400">

# In[ ]:


user = user.merge(u_reorder, on='user_id', how='left')

del u_reorder
gc.collect()

user.head()


# ## 2.2 Create product predictors
# We create the following predictors:
# - 2.2.1 Number of purchases for each product
# - 2.2.2 What is the probability for a product to be reordered
# 
# ### 2.2.1 Number of purchases for each product
# We calculate the total number of purchases for each product (from all customers). We create a **prd** DataFrame to store the results.

# In[ ]:


# Create distinct groups for each product, count the orders, save the result for each product to a new DataFrame  
prd = op.groupby('product_id')['order_id'].count().to_frame('p_total_purchases')
prd.head()


# In[ ]:


# Reset the index of the DF so to bring product_id rom index to column (pre-requisite for step 2.4)
prd = prd.reset_index()
prd.head()


# ## 2.2.2 What is the probability for a product to be reordered
# In this section we want to find the products which have the highest probability of being reordered. Towards this end it is necessary to define the probability as below:
# <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\large&space;probability\&space;reordered\&space;(product\_id)=&space;\frac{number\&space;of\&space;reorders}{total\&space;number\&space;of\&space;orders\&space;}" title="probability\ reordered\ (product\_id)= \frac{number\ of\ reorders}{total\ number\ of\ orders\ }" />
# 
# Example: The product with product_id=2 is included in 90 purchases but only 12 are reorders. So we have:  
# 
# <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\large&space;p\_reorder\(product\_id\mathop{==}&space;2&space;)=&space;\frac{12}{90}=&space;0,133" title="\large p\_reorder\(product\_id\mathop{==} 2 )= \frac{12}{90}= 0,133" />
# 
# ### 2.2.2.1 Remove products with less than 40 purchases - Filter with .shape[0]
# Before we proceed to this estimation, we remove all these products that have less than 40 purchases in order the calculation of the aforementioned ratio to be meaningful.
# 
# Using .groupby() we create groups for each product and using .filter( ) we keep only groups with more than 40 rows. Towards this end, we indicate a lambda function.

# In[ ]:


# execution time: 25 sec
# the x on lambda function is a temporary variable which represents each group
# shape[0] on a DataFrame returns the number of rows
p_reorder = op.groupby('product_id').filter(lambda x: x.shape[0] >40)
p_reorder.head()


# ### 2.2.2.2 Group products, calculate the mean of reorders
# 
# To calculate the reorder probability we will use the aggregation function mean() to the reordered column. In the reorder data frame, the reordered column indicates that a product has been reordered when the value is 1.
# 
# The .mean() calculates how many times a product has been reordered, divided by how many times has been ordered in total. 
# 
# E.g., for a product that has been ordered 9 times in total, where 4 times has been reordered, the ratio will be:
# 
# ![example ratio](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{120}&space;\large&space;&space;mean=&space;\frac{0&plus;1&plus;0&plus;0&plus;1&plus;1&plus;0&plus;0&plus;1}{9}&space;=&space;0,44) 
# 
# We calculate the ratio for each product. The aggregation function is limited to column 'reordered' and it calculates the mean value of each group.

# In[ ]:


p_reorder = p_reorder.groupby('product_id')['reordered'].mean().to_frame('p_reorder_ratio')
p_reorder = p_reorder.reset_index()
p_reorder.head()


# ### 2.2.2.3 Merge the new feature on prd DataFrame
# The new feature will be merged with the prd DataFrame (section 2.2.1) which keep all the features based on products. We perform a left join as we want to keep all the products that we have created on the prd DataFrame
# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dOVWPKb.jpg" width="400">

# In[ ]:


#Merge the prd DataFrame with reorder
prd = prd.merge(p_reorder, on='product_id', how='left')

#delete the reorder DataFrame
del p_reorder
gc.collect()

prd.head()


# #### 2.2.2.4 Fill NaN values
# As you may notice, there are product with NaN values. This regards the products that have been purchased less than 40 times from all users and were not included in the p_reorder DataFrame. **As we performed a left join with prd DataFrame, all the rows with products that had less than 40 purchases from all users, will get a NaN value.**
# 
# For these products we their NaN value with zero (0):

# In[ ]:


prd['p_reorder_ratio'] = prd['p_reorder_ratio'].fillna(value=0)
prd.head()


# > Our final DataFrame should not have any NaN values, otherwise the fitting process (chapter 4) will throw an error!

# ## 2.3 Create user-product predictors
# We create the following predictors:
# - 2.3.1 How many times a user bought a product
# - 2.3.2 How frequently a customer bought a product after its first purchase
# - 2.3.3 How many times a customer bought a product on its last 5 orders
# 
# ### 2.3.1 How many times a user bought a product
# We create different groups that contain all the rows for each combination of user and product. With the aggregation function .count( ) we get how many times each user bought a product. We save the results on new **uxp** DataFrame.

# In[ ]:


# Create distinct groups for each combination of user and product, count orders, save the result for each user X product to a new DataFrame 
uxp = op.groupby(['user_id', 'product_id'])['order_id'].count().to_frame('uxp_total_bought')
uxp.head()


# In[ ]:


# Reset the index of the DF so to bring user_id & product_id rom indices to columns (pre-requisite for step 2.4)
uxp = uxp.reset_index()
uxp.head()


# ### 2.3.2 How frequently a customer bought a product after its first purchase
# This ratio is a metric that describes how many times a user bought a product out of how many times she had the chance to a buy it (starting from her first purchase of the product):
# 
# <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{120}&space;\large&space;probability\&space;reordered\&space;(user\_id\&space;,&space;product\_id)&space;=&space;\frac{Times\_Bought\_N}{Order\_Range\_D}" title="\large probability\ reordered\ (user\_id\ , product\_id) = \frac{Times\_Bought\_N}{Order\_Range\_D}" />
# 
# * Times_Bought_N = Times a user bought a product
# * Order_Range_D = Total orders placed since the first user's order of a product
# 
# To clarify this, we examine the use with user_id:1 and the product with product_id:13032. User 1 has made 10 orders in total.She has bought the product 13032 **for first time in her 2nd order** and she has bought the same product 3 times in total. The user was able to buy the product 9 times (starting from her 2nd order until her last order). As a result, she has bought it 3 out of 9 times, meaning reorder_ratio=3/9= 0,333.
# 
# The Order_Range_D variable is created using two supportive variables:
# * Total_orders = Total number of orders of each user
# * First_order_number = The order number where the customer bought a product for first time
# 
# In the next blocks we show how we create:
# 1. The numerator 'Times_Bought_N'
# 2. The denumerator 'Order_Range_D' with the use of the supportive variables 'total_orders' & 'first_order_number' 
# 3. Our final ratio 'uxp_order_ratio'

# ### 2.3.2.1 Calculate the numerator ('Times_Bought_N')
# 
# To answer this question we simply .groupby( ) user_id & product_id and we count the instances of order_id for each group.

# In[ ]:


times = op.groupby(['user_id', 'product_id'])[['order_id']].count()
times.columns = ['Times_Bought_N']
times.head()


# ### 2.3.2.2 Calculate the denumerator ('Order_Range_D')
# To calculate the denumerator, we first calculate the total orders of each user & first order number for each user and every product purchase.
# 
# In order to calculate the total number of orders of each cutomer ('total_orders') we .groupby( ) only by the user_id, we keep the column order_number and we get its highest value with the aggregation function .mean()

# In[ ]:


total_orders = op.groupby('user_id')['order_number'].max().to_frame('total_orders')
total_orders.head()


# In order to calculate the order number where the user bought a product for first time ('first_order_number') we .groupby( ) by both user_id & product_id and we select the order_number column and we retrieve the .min( ) value.

# In[ ]:


first_order_no = op.groupby(['user_id', 'product_id'])['order_number'].min().to_frame('first_order_number')
first_order_no  = first_order_no.reset_index()
first_order_no.head()


# We merge the first order number with the total_orders DataFrame. As total_orders refers to all users, where first_order_no refers to unique combinations of user & product, we perform a right join:
# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bhln0tn.jpg" width="250">

# In[ ]:


span = pd.merge(total_orders, first_order_no, on='user_id', how='right')
span.head()


# The denominator ('Order_Range_D') now can be created with simple operations between the columns of span DataFrame:

# In[ ]:


# The +1 includes in the difference the first order were the product has been purchased
span['Order_Range_D'] = span.total_orders - span.first_order_number + 1
span.head()


# ### 2.3.2.3 Create the final ratio "uxp_reorder_ratio"
# 
# We merge **times** DataFrame, which contains the numerator, and **span** DataFrame, which contains the denumerator of our desired ratio. **As both variables derived from the combination of users & products, any type of join will keep all the combinations.**
# 
# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/h7m1bFh.jpg" width="250">

# In[ ]:


uxp_ratio = pd.merge(times, span, on=['user_id', 'product_id'], how='left')
uxp_ratio.head()


# 
# We divide the Times_Bought_N by the Order_Range_D for each user and product.

# In[ ]:


uxp_ratio['uxp_reorder_ratio'] = uxp_ratio.Times_Bought_N / uxp_ratio.Order_Range_D
uxp_ratio.head()


# 
# We select to keep only the 'user_id', 'product_id' and the final feature 'uxp_reorder_ratio'
# 

# In[ ]:


uxp_ratio = uxp_ratio.drop(['Times_Bought_N', 'total_orders', 'first_order_number', 'Order_Range_D'], axis=1)
uxp_ratio.head()


# In[ ]:


#Remove temporary DataFrames
del [times, first_order_no, span]


# ### 2.3.2.4 Merge the final feature with uxp DataFrame
# The new feature will be merged with the uxp DataFrame (section 2.3.1) which keep all the features based on combinations of user-products. We perform a left join as we want to keep all the user-products that we have created on the uxp DataFrame
# 
# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hPJXBuB.jpg" width="250">

uxp = uxp.merge(uxp_ratio, on=['user_id', 'product_id'], how='left')

del uxp_ratio
uxp.head()


# ### 2.3.3 How many times a customer bought a product on its last 5 orders
# For this feature, we want to keep the last five orders for each customer and get how many times bought any product on them. To achieve this we need to:
# * Create a new variable ('order_number_back') which keeps the order_number for each order in reverse order
# * Keep only the last five orders for each order
# * Perform a .groupby( ) on users and products to get how many times each customer bought a product.
# * Create the following ratio:
# 
# ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?times%5C%20last%20%5C5%5C%20%28of%5C%20a%5C%20purchased%5C%20product%5C%20from%5C%20a%5C%20user%29%3D%5Cfrac%7BTimes%5C%20a%5C%20user%5C%20bought%5C%20a%5C%20product%5C%20on%5C%20its%5C%20last%5C%205%5C%20orders%7D%7BTotal%5C%20orders%5C%20%3D5%7D)

# #### 2.3.3.1 Create a new variable ('order_number_back') which keeps the order_number for each order in reverse order
# In this step we show how we create a reverse order_number for each customer. <br>
# Have a look at the orders of customer 1 (user_id == 1)

# In[ ]:


op[op.user_id==1].head(45)


# Our goal is a to create a new column ('order_number_back') which indicates the last order as first, the second from the end as second and so on. To achieve this, we get the highest order_number (max) for user_id==1 and we subtract the order_number of each order from it. Thus for last order (order_number == 10) that will be: 
# <br>
# <br>
# 
# ![order_number_back](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B200%7D%20%5Ctiny%20%5Cfontsize%7B%20%7D%7Bbaselineskip%7D%20order%5C_number%5C_back%28x%29%3D%20order%5C_number.max%28%29%20-order%5C_number%28x%29%3D10%20-%2010%20%3D%200)
# 
# And as we want the last order to be marked as first, rather than zeroth, the previous formula will be:
# 
# ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B200%7D%20%5Ctiny%20%5Cfontsize%7B%20%7D%7Bbaselineskip%7D%20order%5C_number%5C_back%28x%29%3D%20order%5C_number.max%28%29%20-order%5C_number%28x%29%3D10%20-%2010%20&plus;1%3D%201)
# 
# > Note that order_number.max( ) is a single value, where order_number is a 1-D array (column/Series)
# 
# By applying the above formula to the orders of user_id == 1 we get the following results:
# ![](https://i.imgur.com/toda8ay.png)

# In the next code block we perform the same calculations for all users. We .groupby( ) op by the user_id and we select the column order_number. With .transform(max) we request to get the highest number of the column order_number for each group & with minus (-) op.order_number we substract the order_number of each row. Finally we add 1 for the reason mentioned above.
# 
# > .transform( ) perform some group-specific computations and return a like-indexed object. 

# In[ ]:


op['order_number_back'] = op.groupby('user_id')['order_number'].transform(max) - op.order_number +1 
op.head(15)


# Check that the formula has been applied to all users. Here we check the new column for a random user (user_id== 7):

# In[ ]:


op[op.user_id==7].head(10)


# #### 2.3.3.2 Keep only the last five orders for each customer
# With the use of order_number_back we can now select to keep only the last five orders of each customer:

# In[ ]:


op5 = op[op.order_number_back <= 5]
op5.head(15)


# #### 2.3.3.3 Perform a .groupby( ) on users and products to get how many times each customer bought every product.
# Having kept the last 5 orders for each user, we perform a .groupby( ) on user_id & product_id. With .count( ) we get how many times each customer bought a product.

# In[ ]:


last_five = op5.groupby(['user_id','product_id'])[['order_id']].count()
last_five.columns = ['times_last5']
last_five.head(10)


# So for user_id==1, the product 196 has been ordered on all of its last five orders, where the product 35951 has been ordered only one time.

# #### 2.3.3.5 Merge the final feature with uxp DataFrame
# The new feature will be merged with the uxp DataFrame (section 2.3.1) which keep all the features based on combinations of user-products. We perform a left join as we want to keep all the user-products that we have created on the uxp DataFrame
# 
# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ObfHDPl.jpg" width="400">

# In[ ]:


uxp = uxp.merge(last_five, on=['user_id', 'product_id'], how='left')

del [op5 , last_five]
uxp.head()


# #### 2.3.3.6 Fill NaN values
# If you check uxp DataFrame you will notice that some rows have NaN values for our new feature. This happens as there might be products that the customer did not buy on its last five orders. For these cases, we turn NaN values into zero (0) with .fillna(0) method.

# In[ ]:


uxp = uxp.fillna(0)
uxp.head()


# ## 2.4 Merge all features
# We now merge the DataFrames with the three types of predictors that we have created (i.e., for the users, the products and the combinations of users and products).
# 
# We will start from the **uxp** DataFrame and we will add the user and prd DataFrames. We do so because we want our final DataFrame (which will be called **data**) to have the following structure: 
# 
# <img style="float: left;" src="https://i.imgur.com/mI5BbFE.jpg" >
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 

# ### 2.4.1 Merge uxp with user DataFrame
# Here we select to perform a left join of uxp with user DataFrame based on matching key "user_id"
# 
# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WlI84Ud.jpg" width="400">
# 
# Left join, ensures that the new DataFrame will have:
# - all the observations of the uxp (combination of user and products) DataFrame 
# - all the **matching** observations of user DataFrame with uxp based on matching key **"user_id"**
# 
# The new DataFrame as we have already mentioned, will be called **data**.

# In[ ]:


#Merge uxp features with the user features
#Store the results on a new DataFrame
data = uxp.merge(user, on='user_id', how='left')
data.head()


# ### 2.4.1 Merge data with prd DataFrame
# In this step we continue with our new DataFrame **data** and we perform a left join with prd DataFrame. The matching key here is the "product_id".
# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Iak6nIz.jpg" width="400">
# 
# Left join, ensures that the new DataFrame will have:
# - all the observations of the data (features of userXproducts and users) DataFrame 
# - all the **matching** observations of prd DataFrame with data based on matching key **"product_id"**

# In[ ]:


#Merge uxp & user features (the new DataFrame) with prd features
data = data.merge(prd, on='product_id', how='left')
data.head()


# ### 2.4.2 Delete previous DataFrames

# The information from the DataFrames that we have created to store our features (op, user, prd, uxp) is now stored on **data**. 
# 
# As we won't use them anymore, we now delete them.

# In[ ]:


del op, user, prd, uxp
gc.collect()


# # 3. Create train and test DataFrames
# ## 3.1 Include information about the last order of each user
# 
# The **data** DataFrame that we have created on the previous chapter (2.4) should include two more columns which define the type of user (train or test) and the order_id of the future order.
# This information can be found on the initial orders DataFrame which was provided by Instacart:

# 
# 
# Towards this end:
# 1. We select the **orders** DataFrame to keep only the future orders (labeled as "train" & "test). 
# 2. Keep only the columns of our desire ['eval_set', 'order_id'] <span style="color:red">**AND** </span> 'user_id' as is the matching key with our **data** DataFrame
# 2. Merge **data** DataFrame with the information for the future order of each customer using as matching key the 'user_id'

# To filter and select the columns of our desire on orders (the 2 first steps) there are numerous approaches:

# In[ ]:


## First approach:
# In two steps keep only the future orders from all customers: train & test 
orders_future = orders[((orders.eval_set=='train') | (orders.eval_set=='test'))]
orders_future = orders_future[ ['user_id', 'eval_set', 'order_id'] ]
orders_future.head(10)

## Second approach (if you want to test it you have to re-run the notebook):
# In one step keep only the future orders from all customers: train & test 
#orders_future = orders.loc[((orders.eval_set=='train') | (orders.eval_set=='test')), ['user_id', 'eval_set', 'order_id'] ]
#orders_future.head(10)

## Third approach (if you want to test it you have to re-run the notebook):
# In one step exclude all the prior orders so to deal with the future orders from all customers
#orders_future = orders.loc[orders.eval_set!='prior', ['user_id', 'eval_set', 'order_id'] ]
#orders_future.head(10)


# To fulfill step 3, we merge on **data** DataFrame the information for the last order of each customer. The matching key here is the user_id and we select a left join as we want to keep all the observations from **data** DataFrame.
# 
# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/m3pNVDW.jpg" width="400">

# In[ ]:


# bring the info of the future orders to data DF
data = data.merge(orders_future, on='user_id', how='left')
data.head(10)


# ## 3.2 Prepare the train DataFrame
# In order to prepare the train Dataset, which will be used to create our prediction model, we need to include also the response (Y) and thus have the following structure:
# 
# <img style="float: left;" src="https://i.imgur.com/PDu2vfR.jpg" >
# 
# Towards this end:
# 1. We keep only the customers who are labelled as "train" from the competition
# 2. For these customers we get from order_products_train the products that they have bought, in order to create the response variable (reordered:1 or 0)
# 3. We make all the required manipulations on that dataset and we remove the columns that are not predictors
# 
# So now we filter the **data** DataFrame so to keep only the train users:

# In[ ]:


#Keep only the customers who we know what they bought in their future order
data_train = data[data.eval_set=='train']
data_train.head()


# For these customers we get from order_products_train the products that they have bought. The matching keys are here two: the "product_id" & "order_id". A left join keeps all the observations from data_train DataFrame
# 
# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kndys9d.jpg" width="400">

# In[ ]:


#Get from order_products_train all the products that the train users bought bought in their future order
data_train = data_train.merge(order_products_train[['product_id','order_id', 'reordered']], on=['product_id','order_id'], how='left' )
data_train.head(15)


# On the last columm (reordered) you can find out our response (y). 
# There are combinations of User X Product which they were reordered (1) on last order where other were not (NaN value).
# 
# Now we manipulate the data_train DataFrame, to bring it into a structure for Machine Learning (X1,X2,....,Xn, y):
# - Fill NaN values with value zero (regards reordered rows without value = 1)

# In[ ]:


#Where the previous merge, left a NaN value on reordered column means that the customers they haven't bought the product. We change the value on them to 0.
data_train['reordered'] = data_train['reordered'].fillna(0)
data_train.head(15)


# - Set as index the column(s) that describe uniquely each row (in our case "user_id" & "product_id")
# 

# In[ ]:


#We set user_id and product_id as the index of the DF
data_train = data_train.set_index(['user_id', 'product_id'])
data_train.head(15)


# - Remove columns which are not predictors (in our case: 'eval_set','order_id')

# In[ ]:


#We remove all non-predictor variables
data_train = data_train.drop(['eval_set', 'order_id'], axis=1)
data_train.head(15)


# ## 3.3 Prepare the test DataFrame
# The test DataFrame must have the same structure as the train DataFrame, excluding the "reordered" column (as it is the label that we want to predict).
# <img style="float: left;" src="https://i.imgur.com/lLJ7wpA.jpg" >
# 
#  To create it, we:
# - Keep only the customers who are labelled as test

# In[ ]:


#Keep only the future orders from customers who are labelled as test
data_test = data[data.eval_set=='test']
data_test.head()


# - Set as index the column(s) that uniquely describe each row (in our case "user_id" & "product_id")
# 

# In[ ]:


#We set user_id and product_id as the index of the DF
data_test = data_test.set_index(['user_id', 'product_id'])
data_test.head()


# - Remove the columns that are predictors (in our case:'eval_set', 'order_id')

# In[ ]:


#We remove all non-predictor variables
data_test = data_test.drop(['eval_set','order_id'], axis=1)
#Check if the data_test DF, has the same number of columns as the data_train DF, excluding the response variable
data_test.head()

# # 7. Get F1 Score

# Before you are ready to submit your prediction to the competion, **ensure that**:
# - **You have used all of the offered data and not the 10% that was defined as an optional step on section 1.2**
# 
# To submit your prediction and get the F1 score you have to:
# 1. Commit this notebook and wait for the results 
# 2. Go to view mode (where you see your notebook but you can't edit it)
# 3. Click on the data section from your left panel
# 4. Find the sub.csv (on outputs), below the section with the data from Instacart
# 5. Click on "Submit to competition" button
# 
# Regarding step 1:
# >This step might take long. If it exceeds 20-30 minutes it would be wise to check your code again. Kaggle won't inform you during commit if the notebook has:
# - syntax errors
# - if it exceeds 16 GB RAM
# - if it takes an algorirthms too much to train or predict
# 
# >Any new commit:
# - can't take more than 9 hours
# - doesn't stop if it exceeds the 16 GB RAM - you will just receive an error of unsuccesful commit after 9 hours
